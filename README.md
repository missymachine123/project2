# project2
For Project 2, you should build a website that has the following functionalities:

1- A home page with a menu page that allows the user to explore the website and move between pages.

2-List of products(minimum ten products). The list of products should show the product's name and price. Each item on the list should open a detailed page about the product with a picture and a short description, including the product name and price.  

3-Add to the cart: Add a button on the product's detailed page that allows the user to add the product to the shopping cart. Also, add a textbox for the quantity, enabling the user to increase and decrease the quantity of the product.

4-Shopping cart page: This shows the list of products the user chose during the current session. And it should have two buttons:

1-Confirm button ( or checkout button) that adds the order items to the database.

2-Customer information button inserts the information into the database (customer table) and keeps the customer ID to add it to the order. If the program succeeds in adding the customer information, enable a checkout button. 

5-Allow the employee to manage the inventory. Add pages that allow the employee to add new products, modify current product quantities and prices, and delete a product. 

6-Allow the employee to manage the orders. Add a page allowing the employee to modify the order status. (For example, the employee changes an order status from ordered to shipped or delivered.)
